  <h2>A CROWD IN HARMONY</h2>
  <p style="margin-top:40px;">A.	It is before dawn on the second major bathing day of the festival, and fog shrouds the river. In a single day, tens of millions of people will bathe in the Ganges River here in Allahabad, India. In the moonlight, the crowds begin to swell on the riverbank. There are thousands here already, but the crowd is calm and united. There is no pushing or panic, only a sense of purpose as pilgrims enter the icy water to bathe and come out again. People cooperate and help one another. Afterward, they are joyful.</p>
  <p style="margin-top:40px;">B.	As the day <strong>progresses</strong>, the number of people stepping into the river increases. Some splash in the water, some drop flowers into it, and others light oil lamps and set them floating on the river. There are men who splash into the water theatrically with swords in hand. There are unwilling children whose parents drag them in fully clothed. There are holy men dressed in bright orange robes with skin covered in <strong>sacred</strong> white ash. There are other devout men wearing the ash but little or no clothing, as their religion requires. There are people everywhere, but somehow, incredibly, no one is stepped on, no one is drowned, and no one is heard screaming for help. All is <strong>harmony</strong>. </p>
  <p style="margin-top:40px;">C.	It is the Kumbh Mela, the largest and most sacred gathering of all Hindu pilgrimages. It is also considered to be the largest peaceful gathering of people anywhere in the world. Each year, as part of the Kumbh, several million Hindus bathe here in the sacred Ganges River. Every 12 years, the gathering becomes much larger, and a giant tent city is set up to house the <strong>participants</strong>. </p>
  <p style="margin-top:40px;">D.	In 2013, the Kumbh lasted 55 days, and it is estimated that 120 million pilgrims participated in activities such as ritual bathing, praying, singing, feeding the poor, and religious discussion. The Kumbh tent city covered more than 25 square kilometers. It was divided into 14 areas, each with its own hospital, police station, roads, grocery store, and supplies of electricity and drinking water-an extraordinary achievement. The basic crowd-control strategy was to avoid dangerous overcrowding at “hot sopts,” such as bridges and train stations. “Incredibly well <strong>organized</strong>, incredibly clean, very efficiently run,” said Rahul Mehrotra, a professor of urban design and planning at Harvard University, who observed the festival. </p>
  <p style="margin-top:40px;"><h4>The Scientific approach</h4>
  E. Psychologists like Stephen Reicher from the University of St. Andrews in the U.K. <strong>suspect</strong> that crowds have a positive impact on the health of the individuals within them. “What our research show is that, actually, crowds are critical to <strong>society</strong>,” he says. “They help form our sense of who we are, they help form our relations to others-they even help determine our physical well-being.” </p>
  <p style="margin-top:40px;">F.	Reicher and his colleagues came to this, the largest Hindu festival, to test the idea that crowds are beneficial and to confirm the healthful effects of the Kumbh on its participants. Before the start of the 2011 festival, his researchers went out into the Indian countryside to question a group of <strong>prospective</strong> pilgrims about their mental and physical health. They also questioned people who didn’t plan to attend. The researchers returned to question both groups a month after the Kumbh had ended. Those who stayed in their villages reported no real change over the period of the study. The pilgrims, on the other hand, reported a 10 percent improvement in their health, including less pain, less anxiety, and higher energy levels. What’s more, the good effects lasted long afterward. </p>
  <p style="margin-top:40px;">G.	Why should belonging to a crowd improve your health? Psychologists think a shared identity is the cause. “You think in terms of ‘we’ rather than ‘I’,” explains Nick Hopkins from the University of Dundee in the U.K. This way of thinking alters human relationships. Members of the crowd support one another, competition becomes cooperation, and people are able to achieve their goals in a way they wouldn’t be able to alone. </p>
  <p style="margin-top:40px;"><h4>The Power of Crowds</h4>
  H. Unfortunately – in spite of the mutual support so <strong>evident</strong> elsewhere at the Kumbh – 36 people died in a stampede at the Allahabad train station on February 10, 2013. Somehow the crowd had lost its harmony. Reicher wrote that one possible cause was that the pilgrims no longer formed a psychological crowd. They no longer saw those around them as fellow pilgrims, but rather as competitors for seats on a train. </p>
  <p style="margin-top:40px;">I.	Strangely, before this unfortunate incident, Reicher had interviewed a pilgrim who was asked to describe the feeling in the crowd at the station. “People think they are more powerful than you. They can push you around,” she said. She was then asked to describe the feeling at the Kumbh: “People are concerned about you. They treat you in a polite manner.” The stampede was an example of what can happen when the psychological cooperation of a crowd breaks down. </p>
  <p style="margin-top:40px;">J.	Incidents such as the stampede are rare at the Kumbh, and this one is unlikely to deter pilgrims from attending the event in the future. The police will undoubtedly learn from this experience and make the station safer. But in crowds as large as those at the Kumbh, individuals must put their faith in the power of “psychological cooperation,” as Stephen Reicher calls it. In other words, “Love thy neighbor.” </p>
